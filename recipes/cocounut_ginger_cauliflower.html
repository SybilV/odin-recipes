    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A dish involving coconut milk, ginger, turneric, and cauliflower for extra GERD-friendliness.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 medium head cauliflower, cut into bite-sized florets</li>
        <li>1 can chickpeas, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp sea salt </li>
        <li>1 can light coconut milk (light is better for GERD than full-fat)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp fresh ginger, finely grated</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable brot</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh spinach or kale</li>
        <li>1 cup cooked brown rice or quinoa</li>
      </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 200°C. Toss the cauliflower and chickpeas with olive oil and salt on a large sheet pan. Roast for 20–25 minutes until the cauliflower is tender and slightly golden.</li>
        <li>While the vegetables roast, place a large skillet over medium heat. Add the light coconut milk, grated ginger, turmeric, and vegetable broth. Bring to a gentle simmer (do not boil rapidly, as coconut milk can separate).</li>
        <li> Let the sauce simmer for about 8–10 minutes until it reduces slightly. If you want it thicker, you can whisk in a teaspoon of cornstarch dissolved in a little water.</li>
        <li>Stir the roasted cauliflower and chickpeas into the sauce. Add the spinach and stir for 1 minute until wilted.</li>
        <li>Divide your cooked rice or quinoa into bowls and ladle the cauliflower mixture over the top. Top with plenty of fresh cilantro. </li>
      </ol>
