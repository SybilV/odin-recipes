    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A dish involving spinach and cannellini beans, that will hopefully be delicious and is GERD-friendly.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup Orzo pasta</li>
        <li>2 large handfuls fresh baby spinach, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 can Cannellini beans, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>3 cups vegetable broth </li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh parsley, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp nutritional yeast (adds a "cheesy" flavor without the fat of dairy)</li>
      </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>In a large non-stick skillet or pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the dry orzo (or rice) and stir for 2 minutes until slightly toasted. This adds a nutty flavor since we aren't using onions.</li>
        <li>Add 1 cup of the broth to the pan. Stir frequently until the liquid is mostly absorbed.</li>
        <li>Add the cannellini beans and another cup of broth. As you stir, gently press down on a few of the beans with the back of your spoon—this releases their starch and makes the "sauce" creamy.</li>
        <li>Add the final cup of broth. Continue to simmer and stir until the orzo is tender and the mixture looks silky.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat. Fold in the chopped spinach and parsley. The residual heat will wilt the spinach in about 30 seconds, keeping it bright green and nutrient-dense. </li>
        <li>Stir in the salt and nutritional yeast (if using).</li>
      </ol>
